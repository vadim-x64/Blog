                    I was thinking about writing a project in Java and didn't know which program to choose for it. And
                    then this IDEA came to me, so I decided to try it. But what can I say - we'll have to see.

                    I took the SpringBoot framework as a basis. It is very suitable for the web and for the database. It
                    offers a lot of different settings and features. But at first there were many difficulties, because
                    I was using it for the first time. Step by step and I figured it all out. I created a cool Telegram
                    bot. And here in the video I show how you can easily and quickly connect a database to the project.
                    The video works in accelerated mode, so you can set the speed to see everything in detail. Go and
                    watch.

                <p>
                    Thanks, great write up. Well configured and reliable terminal is a
                    must for any decent development personally, I donâ€™t care about AI
                    and neither find it useful nor correct.<br><br>
                    P.S. Standalone terminal app would also be a waste of time/effort unless you get it to boot under
                    500ms and use less than 100mb (which might be a challenge for jvm, maybe graalvm can help).

                <p>I guess AI integration will only work if you have an AI subscription.</p>

                <p>Looking forward to it when itâ€™s ready, it seems like a huge undertaking so no need to rush.</p>
